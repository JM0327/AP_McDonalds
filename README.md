# Customized Optimizing McDonald’s Meal Application by J.M.T group
This is a academic project for Advanced Programming cource in 2022. It is a application designed for optimizing McDonald’s meal. The fast-food industry has been growing rapidly over the past decades and become a part of the modern lifestyle, especially in urban areas. However, fast food has also been heavily criticized as a major cause of obesity, diabetes, and many diseases around the world. Among the criticisms and research that pointed out the negative health effect caused by fast food, there were some experiments attempting to prove that eating only McDonald’s 3 meals a day could help reduce weight. Nevertheless, there are more aspects that one needs to consider, besides weight reduction, to determine the long-term effect on the body, such as the level of cholesterol or sodium. Therefore, this project aims to develop an application that utilizes the nutrition information published by McDonald’s and finds the optimal choices for each meal based on individual daily energy intake, estimated using the individual profile. We find that most individuals cannot have adequate calorie intake without over-consuming salt and fat, which proves that items on McDonald’s menu generally have a high level of unwanted nutrients such as sodium.
